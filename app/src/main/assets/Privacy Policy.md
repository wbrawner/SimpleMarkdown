The internet access permission is requested primarily for retrieving images from the internet in
 case you embed them in your markdown, but it also allows me to send automated error and crash
 reports to myself whenever the app runs into an issue. These error reports are opt-out, and are
 powered by [Firebase Crashlytics] (https://firebase.google.com/docs/crashlytics/), which is a
 free error reporting solution provided by Google. These error reports are used exclusively for
 fixing problems that occur while you're using the app, along with some analytics info like how
 long you use the app for, how often, and which features of the app you use. This helps me to
 determine how to spend my very limited time on building out new features. I'll have to defer to
  [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) to explain how they handle the
  data. As for me, I don't knowingly or willingly sell or share your data.
